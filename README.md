Description:

A program which allows you to change the wave length of a square wave which has a 20 millisecond period. Pressing the A button will result in a %5 increase in the signals duty cycle, and Pressing the B button will result in a 5% decrease in the duty cycle.  


## Exploring the servo.write function

[Code used](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Computer-Engineering/final-project-assignment-8-week-13-O11WL1D/blob/master/servo.js)

Description: 
Various tests exploring the servo.write function, which determined that only values passed to the function in the range of 0-180 were capable of changing the pulse width. Moreover, it was found that for each 45 degree increment to the passed value, the pulse width increases by 1.5 milliseconds.
